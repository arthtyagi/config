# vimconfig
This is my vimconfig, I use the MacOS default terminal with vim+tmux+bash theme.
It's all zsh% here :)

### How do I use this?

* Clone this repo : `git clone https://github.com/arthtyagi/vimconfig`
* Move the dotfiles in your home directory.
* Open your vim and type `:so $MYVIMRC`
* Kill the tmux server using `tmux kill-server`
* `sudo reboot`

And, voila! It works :))

To use the standard autcompletion, you just gotta `Ctrl+N` and for extensive autocompletion, download that language's dictionary and load it.
